            “cookies”. Cookies are small text files that we place in your

            of information on users computer, such as a user’s Cookie number,
            time and date of a page view, and description of the page where the
            web beacon is placed. You may render some web beacons unusable if
            you choose to reject their associated cookies. These web beacons may
            be use to deliver cookies that conform with our Cookie Policy.
